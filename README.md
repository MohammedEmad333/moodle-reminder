## Overview

Moodle Reminder turns Moodle's official private iCalendar (`.ics`) export into a focused deadline companion. It keeps an offline cache, refreshes deadlines in the background, schedules local reminders, and never asks for or stores a Moodle password.

The project is designed around privacy, offline usefulness, predictable reminder behavior, and a clean separation between UI, state, parsing, storage, background work, and notifications.

## Latest release

**Moodle Reminder v2.0.0** is the current stable release.

- Android APK: [`moodle-reminder-v2.0.0.apk`](https://github.com/MohammedEmad333/moodle-reminder/releases/download/v2.0.0/moodle-reminder-v2.0.0.apk)
- SHA-256 checksum: [`moodle-reminder-v2.0.0.apk.sha256`](https://github.com/MohammedEmad333/moodle-reminder/releases/download/v2.0.0/moodle-reminder-v2.0.0.apk.sha256)
- Release notes: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/MohammedEmad333/moodle-reminder/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

> For normal installs, use the APK attached to the latest GitHub Release rather than a temporary Actions artifact.

## Highlights

| Area | What Moodle Reminder provides |
| --- | --- |
| Deadline tracking | Home dashboard, urgency states, countdowns, calendar agenda, and course grouping |
| Reminders | Multiple offsets: 3 days, 2 days, 1 day, 6 hours, 1 hour, plus due-now |
| Background sync | Android WorkManager refresh approximately every six hours when constraints allow |
| Offline support | Cached deadlines and last-sync state remain available without a connection |
| Completion state | Mark deadlines completed locally to suppress further reminders |
| Languages | English and Arabic with RTL support |
| Appearance | System, light, and dark themes |
| Moodle integration | Uses Moodle's exported private iCalendar URL; no Moodle password is requested |
| ICS parsing | `UID`, `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, `TZID`, `URL`, `LOCATION`, `STATUS`, `SEQUENCE`, `LAST-MODIFIED`, folded lines, escaped text, and date-only events |
| Reliability | Stable notification IDs derived from Moodle event UIDs and exact-alarm fallback behavior |

## Privacy and security

The Moodle calendar export URL contains a private access token, so Moodle Reminder treats it as a secret.

- The private calendar URL is stored with `flutter_secure_storage`, not plain preferences.
- The app never asks for a Moodle username or password.
- Deadline metadata is cached locally for offline use.
- Disconnecting Moodle removes the secure URL, cached deadlines, sync timestamp, and local completion state from the app.
- `USE_EXACT_ALARM` is intentionally not requested. The app uses `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` with user approval where Android requires it and falls back to inexact scheduling when necessary.

## Getting started

### 1. Export your Moodle calendar

1. Open Moodle.
2. Open **Calendar**.
3. Choose **Export calendar**.
4. Generate and copy the private calendar URL.
5. Open Moodle Reminder.
6. Paste the URL and choose **Connect securely**.

### 2. Install the app

Download the latest Android APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MohammedEmad333/moodle-reminder/releases/latest).

If you want to verify the downloaded file, compare its SHA-256 digest with the `.sha256` file attached to the same release.

## Architecture

```text
lib/
├── main.dart
├── app_controller.dart
├── models/
│   └── deadline.dart
├── screens/
│   └── home_shell.dart
└── services/
    ├── background_sync_service.dart
    ├── calendar_repository.dart
    ├── ics_parser.dart
    └── notification_service.dart
```

### Responsibilities

- **`CalendarRepository`** owns network access, secure calendar URL storage, cached deadlines, and sync metadata.
- **`AppController`** owns application state and coordinates user-facing actions.
- **ICS parser** converts Moodle iCalendar data into normalized deadline models.
- **Background sync service** refreshes the feed under Android WorkManager constraints.
- **Notification service** schedules and updates local reminders using stable IDs.
- **UI layer** consumes controller state and does not directly own persistence or network logic.

Compatibility export files remain at `lib/ics_parser.dart` and `lib/notification_service.dart` for code importing the original paths.

## Reminder model

For each upcoming deadline, Moodle Reminder can schedule reminders at:

- 3 days before
- 2 days before
- 1 day before
- 6 hours before
- 1 hour before
- due time

Completed or expired deadlines are excluded from future reminder scheduling. Stable IDs derived from Moodle event UIDs reduce duplicate-notification problems across refreshes.

## Background behavior

Android WorkManager refreshes the calendar approximately every six hours, subject to operating-system scheduling, connectivity, and battery constraints. It is intentionally not treated as an exact six-hour timer.

After a successful refresh, the app updates its offline cache and rebuilds the local reminder schedule from the latest Moodle data.

## Android permissions

Moodle Reminder uses:

- `INTERNET` — download the Moodle calendar feed.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — request notification permission on supported Android versions.
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` — request precise alarm access where applicable.
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` — allow reminder scheduling to recover after device reboot.

## Development

### Requirements

- Flutter 3.38.1 or newer
- Dart 3.10 or newer
- Java 17 for Android builds

The CI and release workflows currently pin Flutter **3.47.6**.

### Local verification

```bash
flutter pub get
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --release
```

### Run locally

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Testing and CI

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous verification. Pull requests and pushes to `main` run formatting checks, static analysis, unit tests, and a release APK build.

`test/ics_parser_test.dart` covers important calendar parsing behavior including:

- UTC timestamps
- folded iCalendar lines
- date-only events
- event metadata
- malformed event handling

The release workflow independently verifies the source before publishing a versioned APK and SHA-256 checksum to GitHub Releases.

## Release process

Release publishing is automated.

1. Update `version` in `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Add the matching version section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Merge the release metadata to `main`.
4. The release workflow verifies the source, builds the APK, generates its checksum, and publishes the GitHub Release.

For the current app version `2.0.0+2`, the public tag is `v2.0.0`.

## Project goals

Moodle Reminder focuses on a small, reliable product surface rather than trying to replace Moodle itself:

- make upcoming work visible at a glance;
- keep useful deadline data available offline;
- deliver reminders even when the Moodle web UI is not open;
- protect the private calendar token;
- support Arabic and English cleanly;
- keep the calendar parser and reminder pipeline testable.
